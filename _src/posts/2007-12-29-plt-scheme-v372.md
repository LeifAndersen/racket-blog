PLT Scheme version 372 is now available from [http://download.plt-scheme.org/](http://download.plt-scheme.org/)

This is mostly a bug-fix release.

Changes:

  * DrScheme now supports name completion via Ctl-/ (Windows and X) or Cmd-/
    (Mac OS X). Completion is sensitive to the current language in DrScheme, but it
    is not sensitive to lexical bindings.
  * DrScheme's stepper now supports the "check-expect", "check-within", and
    "check-error" forms of the testing.ss teachpack.  A number of bug fixes and
    small improvements for ProfessorJ. The grammar for the current release slightly
    differs from the one in HtDC.

Feedback Welcome.
