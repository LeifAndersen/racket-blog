DrScheme has five birthday easter eggs in it, one for each of the main
contributers to the PLT Scheme infrastructure ([Matthias](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/),
[Matthew](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/), [Eli](http://www.barzilay.org/),
[Shriram](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/), and [me](http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/)).
I put four of them in there, and mostly concentrated on making them
fun. Matthew added mine and the best part of that one is figuring out on earth
it shows up (it is quite tricky to find the code that actually makes that one
appear).

I don't want to ruin the fun of searching for the Easter Eggs yourself, but
just to get you started, do have a look at
[plt/collects/framework/private/bday.ss](http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/trunk/collects/framework/private/bday.ss)
for Matthias, Matthew, Shriram, and Eli's birthdays. Mine is July 2nd.

Happy Hunting!
