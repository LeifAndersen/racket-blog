DrScheme now supports a language-sensitive (but not lexical-scope sensitive)
completion feature. Type <menukey>-/ and see what names are available to finish
off the word you're typing.

Thanks to [Jacob](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jacobm/) (and do follow that link; we all need a little more love in our
lives) and [Mike](http://turingcompletewasteoftime.blogspot.com/) for taking the initiative to actually implement what is
probably the most requested feature in DrScheme at the moment.
