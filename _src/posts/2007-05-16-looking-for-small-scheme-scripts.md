    Title: Looking for small Scheme scripts

As part of the [Typed Scheme](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/samth/typed-scheme.html) project, we are
looking for small Scheme scripts that we can port from PLT Scheme to Typed
Scheme. We would like to investigate if Typed Scheme is capable of checking
idiomatic PLT Scheme code, as represented by scripts written by members of the
PLT Scheme community.

Therefore, if you have a simple PLT Scheme program which handles a
scripting/processing task, and you are willing to share it with us for the
improvement of Typed Scheme, please let me know. Typed Scheme currently handles
all of 'core' MzScheme, as well as many of the collections (the major
exceptions are the class and unit systems).

In return, we will inform you of any bugs that we discover during the port.
