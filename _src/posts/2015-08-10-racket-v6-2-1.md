Racket v6.2.1 is now available from <http://racket-lang.org/>

Version 6.2.1 patches the recent v6.2 release in three small ways:

* For the How to Design Programs teaching languages, DrRacket offers
  an option to use the old style for printing the constants true,
  `false`, and `empty` instead of `#true`, `#false`, and `'()`.
* The teaching languages come with some additional functions to match
  the August 2015
  [stable release of HtDP 2nd edition](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html).
* A repair to the compiler avoids an infinite loop at compile time for certain expressions that should loop forever at run time.
